				<h2>Season 1</h2>

					</div>
				<p>In 1983, the Winchesters John, Mary and their two sons Dean and Sam were a normal family living in Lawrence, Kansas but
				one night a powerful yellow-eyed demon named Azazel killed Mary for an unknown reason. Over the next 22 years John
				raised his boys as hunters, human vigilantes who hunt down supernatural creatures and beings, while John looked for the
				demon who killed Mary and the means to kill it. Dean was always protective of his brother and loyal to his father, but
				Sam was always resistant to both of them and the hunting life itself, and he eventually left to attend Stanford on a
				full ride. </p>
				<p>In 2005, Sam has retired from hunting to focus on college, but Dean brings him back into that life after their father
				John goes missing and after Sam comes back from hunting a ghost with Dean, Sam's girlfriend Jessica Moore is killed by
				Azazel, just like their mother was. The two brothers then embark on hunting quests across the country as they look for
				John and also work on cases involving other supernatural creatures, from ghosts, to shapeshifters, deities, and even
				vampires. Along the way, they discover that Sam has unusual abilities such as telekinesis and visions of the future,
				which the boys come to think is related to the demon they're hunting. Sam and Dean also face the recurring villain Meg,
				a demon minion of Azazel.</p>
				<p>Eventually the boys find their father, who has discovered the means to kill Azazel: an old, antique revolver called The
				Colt, a firearm weapon created in 1835 by Samuel Colt to kill anything supernatural--but it only has a limited amount
				of bullets. After finding The Colt, John is forced by Meg to hand it over. He instead uses a fake gun while Sam and
				Dean attempt to kill Azazel with the real one, but the demon escapes and John is captured. Sam and Dean, with the help
				of old and close family friend Bobby Singer, find and exorcise Meg from her host, get John's location and find him, but
				only have two Colt bullets left. Azazel is revealed to be possessing John and announces that he has plans for Sam; he
				tries to kill Dean, though John re-takes control while Sam shoots him in the leg, forcing Azazel to leave John's
				body.</p>
				<p>As the three Winchesters leave with their war-wounds to re-track Azazel, a demon in a truck rams into the Impala,
				smashing it and knocking out the family.</p>

				<p>The season follows Sam and Dean Winchester as they deal with their father's death and continue to hunt down the
				yellow-eyed demon known as Azazel, who caused the fire that led to the deaths of their mother over 20 years ago and
				later, Sam's girlfriend, Jessica Moore. They have assistance not only from their friend Bobby, but from new allies
				Ellen Harvelle, her daughter Jo, and Ash.</p>
				<p>Part of Azazel's master plan is eventually revealed as he gathers Sam and others like him, leading to Sam's death. Dean
				makes a deal with a crossroads demon to resurrect Sam in exchange for his soul, which will be collected in one year. In a
				final confrontation, in which Dean kills Azazel with The Colt using the last of the original bullets, a gate is opened,

				<p>The brothers eventually learn what demon holds Dean's contract, a white-eyed demonic being of great power named

					</div>
				<p>After spending four long, horrific months in Hell, Dean Winchester is miraculously raised from the Underworld and
				resurrected by an angel of the Lord God Himself named Castiel, one of several angels who appears throughout the season.
				After Dean reunites with his father-figure friend Bobby and his brother Sam, the rest of the season follows the
				brothers, with the help of their friend Bobby, as they work with Castiel and his subordinate and friend Uriel to stop
				Lilith's plan of breaking the 66 Seals, which would allow the fallen archangel Lucifer himself, AKA Satan or The Devil
				(who was once the favored angel of God but rebelled against Heaven for not serving humans and therefore was cast down),
				to be released from his cage in Hell.</p>
				<p>Along the way, the boys meet a girl named Anna who not only has the ability to hear angels but is also a fallen angel
				herself. Eventually, angels turn up dead and the angels capture Alastair, Hell's Grand Torturer demon who seems to
				know Dean well, and they ask Dean to torture him with them assuming its the demons killing the angels, but Alastair,
				before he dies, says its not the demons. And eventually, Castiel learns that his own brother Uriel turns out to not
				only be working for Lucifer, but has convinced several loyalist angels to join him and to free Lucifer from his cage.
				Along the way, Dean learns that he broke the first seal while he was in Hell by being convinced by Alastair to
				slaughter innocent souls in the Underworld, especially when he reveals to Sam that he wasn't in Hell for four months
				but instead 40 years. Additionally, the brothers meet a Prophet of the Lord named Chuck.</p>
				<p>Sam and Dean's relationship is also strained as Sam starts siding with Ruby over Dean. He also begins to give into his
				demonic side by drinking demon blood to become strong enough to kill Lilith. After tracking down and killing Lilith,
				Sam learns her death is actually the final seal and Ruby was deceiving him all along. Dean arrives too late to stop
				him, but the brothers kill Ruby as Lucifer's prison opens up beneath them and he walks out free.</p>

				<h2>Season 5</h2>

					</div>
				<p>Immediately after Sam frees Lucifer from Hell, he and Dean become targets of both Heaven and Hell. They are threats
				because they are destined to be the respective vessels of Lucifer and the Archangel Michael, the eldest of the
				archangels and the one responsible to casting Lucifer from Heaven, who will fight in a destined match to determine
				Earth's future. This would result in the deaths of millions of innocent people who would be in the crosshairs. If Dean
				refuses Michael, Lucifer will destroy the human race with the Four Horsemen, the living embodiments of the four plagues,
				however Sam saying yes to Lucifer will only speed up the devil's plans. Additionally Bobby is crippled and
				wheelchair-bound. Faced with no other choice, Sam and Dean team up with their angel ally and friend Castiel to look
				for a means to defeat both Heaven and Hell whilst battling angels, demons and even archangels.</p>
				<p>Their journey pushes the Winchesters' relationship to the breaking point as they both learn how they truly feel about
				each other and at points agree with Michael and Lucifer. Both from distrust in each other and from not seeing any other
				choice. They also learn that Michael and Lucifer are a lot alike and what Sam and Dean potentially could be, only
				further persuading them when Sam and Dean themselves become distant. The boys' journey also leads to the deaths of
				many of their dear friends such as Ellen and Jo while other old friends such as Anna side against them and the Four
				Horsemen continue to bring Hell to Earth as the brothers seem to think all hope is lost even after some personal
				encounters with Lucifer and Michael themselves. Meanwhile, Castiel begins a mission to find God even going as far as
				to face the archangel Raphael to find him, only to deduce from the angel Joshua, the angel who talks to God, that God
				won't help. Additionally, the brothers try to kill Lucifer with the Colt, who regain it from a powerful crossroads
				demon named Crowley, who is also the King of the Crossroads and wants the boys to kill Lucifer, but the they do not
				succeed. However, the boys eventually gain hope from the Trickster, who is actually the archangel Gabriel (who is the
				youngest of the archangels and left Heaven because he couldn't take the fighting between his brothers), and who also,
				after re-gaining his faith in humanity, tells Sam and Dean that the Rings of the Four Horsemen are keys to Lucifer's
				Cage and that the brothers can trap Lucifer. So Sam, Dean, Castiel, Bobby, and Crowley (who restores Bobby's legs) all
				go after the rings and after gaining them, Sam willingly decides to let Lucifer possess him to he can take back control,
				open the cage, and fall in.</p>
				<p>In the season finale, their plan falters and Lucifer fully possesses Sam while Michael meets him on the battlefield.
				As the brothers talk, Lucifer tries to convince Michael to have them both "walk off the chess board" but Michael won't
				listen and decides to have an altercation with Lucifer. Dean, after finding the battlefield with help from Chuck the
				prophet, rides onto the field with the Impala in a desperate attempt to get through to Sam but Lucifer instead beats
				Dean to a pulp as he explodes Castiel and snaps Bobby's neck but in the end the Winchesters' love proves more powerful
				than Lucifer's rage and Sam re-takes control, opens the cage door and falls in bringing, Lucifer, Michael, and Adam
				into it with him. A resurrected Castiel, who is now more powerful than before, then heals Dean, brings back Bobby and
				the trio part their separate ways. While Castiel returns to Heaven to possibly try and rule it and Bobby resumes
				hunting, Dean, on Sam's insistence, goes to Lisa and retires from killing monsters and begins a new and normal life
				away from hunting to be with her. That same night, however, Sam appears outside their house mysteriously.</p>

					</div>
				<p>The sixth season begins about a year after the end happenings of the fifth with Dean living a normal life with Lisa
				Braeden and her son Ben. Sam mysteriously and miraculously returns to Earth and reunites with Dean, who leaves his new
				life behind. Sam has been working with their grandfather, Samuel Campbell (their mother's father), in order to capture
				the Alpha monsters (first of the gene pool).</p>
				<p>Bobby eventually gets his soul back from the crossroads demon Crowley, who has apparently become the King of Hell. It
				is eventually discovered that Samuel is following Crowley's orders in exchange for the resurrection of his daughter,
				Sam and Dean's mother.</p>
				<p>Castiel is barely helpful anymore because a civil war in Heaven against the archangel Raphael (who wants to take
				over Heaven, free both Michael and Lucifer from the Cage, and start the Apocalypse again) has taken its toll. Crowley
				wants to use the Alpha Monsters to locate Purgatory, a supernatural realm that is filled with the souls of every
				monster that has ever been killed (vampires, werewolves, wendigos, skinwalkers, even shapeshifters etc.) and in which
				there are a vast collection of souls that could be used for power.</p>
				<p>Castiel brought back Sam without his soul, and Dean implores the help of the Horseman Death in order to retrieve it.
				Death puts a wall up in Sam's mind so that he will not remember Hell. Sam's original personality is restored with no
				memory of the past year and a half. It turns out Castiel made a deal with Crowley for both of them to receive half of
				the souls in Purgatory. Dean doesn't like the idea and tries to stop the duo. To stop the Winchesters and Bobby Singer,
				Castiel knocks down the mental barrier in Sam. Castiel betrays Crowley, who then allies himself with Raphael and
				performs the ritual to open the doors of Purgatory. It fails because they had fake dog's blood and Castiel appears
				full of power from having done the ritual himself. He obliterates Raphael and Crowley escapes. When the Winchesters
				try to reason with Castiel, he reveals that he is not an angel anymore, he has become the new God.</p>

					</div>
				<p>In season seven, the events take place right after the angel Castiel absorbed the souls of Purgatory declares himself
				as the new God. And the "mutated angel" goes around the planet to try and finish his "work". But eventually, thanks to
				a little bit of help from the Horseman Death, Winchesters convince the angel to return all the souls back to Purgatory.
				But Castiel manages to return all but the souls of some older creatures. Something in which the Winchesters will find
				themselves in an increasingly sinister, changing landscape, as they go up against this new foe, which is unlike
				anything they've ever fought before: the Leviathans, the very first beasts created by God Himself, but were then
				locked away in Purgatory for being too destructive. They brothers will find their old tricks, weapons and hiding
				places all rendered useless. All they'll have is each other. And the certainty that, like the last of the cowboy
				outlaws, whatever they face, they're not going down without a fight.</p>
				<p>Season seven finds Dean and Sam reeling from the loss of Bobby and without the help of Castiel. Sam's violent memories
				of Hell threaten to overtake him, threatening not just his life, but his brother's as well. Meanwhile, Dean struggles
				under the weight of a secret that threatens to tear them apart. And even as the brothers traverse the backroads of
				America, hunting things that go bump in the night, something is coming for them. They are about to face an enemy more
				cunning and adaptable than any they've ever fought. As the landscape around them becomes increasingly treacherous, the
				tools they've come to rely upon will be stripped away. Our heroes, like so many outlaws before them, will find
				themselves utterly outmatched and outgunned and pushed to their limites, with no one to rely on but each other.</p>
				<p>As the season progresses the Leviathans become a much greater threat where Sam and Dean are forced to form an alliance
				with a ressurected Castiel, Meg, Crowley, a ghostly Bobby Singer and the prophet Kevin Tran to defeat the Leviathans
				and their leader Dick Roman with a weapon forged by God Himself. Bobby begins to turn into a vengeful spirit forcing
				Sam and Dean to destroy him. Dean manages to kill Dick but the after effects cause him and Castiel to end up in
				Purgatory while Crowley abducts Meg and Kevin and with Bobby dead Sam is completely alone...</p>

				<p>One year after the defeat of the Leviathans, Dean escapes Purgatory, with a vampire-comrade-in-arms named Benny, and
				reunites with Sam who has retired from hunting much to Dean's anger. Not long after Dean discovers that Kevin had
				escaped Crowley's abduction months ago which Sam was unaware of. Kevin reveals that he stole another Word of God from
				Crowley about Demons and discovered the means of closing Hell forever with all demons inside. Now reunited Sam and Dean
				embark on their monster hunts while Kevin continues to translate the tablet to stop Crowley and his plotting.</p>
				<p>Sam and Dean's relationship is challenged as Sam stopped hunting for a year which he claims is because he had no one
				to force him anymore with Dean and Castiel gone, Bobby dead and Kevin and Meg missing. Dean, however, remains in
				contact with Benny who is trying to live without killing but is missing Purgatory but Sam becomes angry that Dean
				would let a vampire live.</p>
				<p>The season also features flashbacks in both Sam and Dean's past year on Earth and Purgatory. For Dean he fought
				monsters for a year until Benny saved him and told him of a portal which could transport humans out. Dean and Benny
				find Castiel and the three fight past Leviathans to make it to the portal but Castiel refuses to leave. As for Sam he
				retired from hunting and met a women named Amelia and lived a normal life with her, however she discovered that her
				husband, a soldier presumed KIA, was still alive and Sam left to allow her to reunite with her. Eventually Castiel
				returns, freed from Purgatory by the mysterious but powerful angel Naomi under her control to spy on the Winchesters
				for her own motives. Meanwhile Amelia returns to Sam to re-connect but Sam pushes her away for good while Benny helps
				Dean by dying and returning to Purgatory to help Sam and Bobby pass through Purgatory to Earth but chooses the stay
				there.</p>
				<p>Kevin eventually learns the three trials to sealing Hell from the Demon Tablet: kill a Hellhound and bathe in its blood,
				free a soul from Hell (who turns out to be Bobby) wrongfully imprisoned, and finally cure a demon who they choose to
				use on Crowley. However the Winchesters and Castiel learn from Meg, before she is killed by Crowley, of the Angel
				Tablet which Naomi tries to have Castiel steal for her own uses but he resits and flees from everyone. Additionally
				Sam and Dean encounter their grandfather Henry and a powerful demon named Abaddon who is a Knight of Hell, among the
				oldest and most powerful demons. While Henry is killed and Abaddon is decomissioned, they tell them of a bunker
				belonging to the Men of Letters, the collectors of information on the supernatural who entrust a few hunters to handle
				the most powerful monsters. Eventually during the trials Sam and Dean encounter an angel named Metatron, the Scribe of
				God and the creator of the tablets who then reveals the nature of the angel tablet to Castiel: to seal Heaven and its
				angels and works with Castiel to fulfill this mission. Meanwhile, after Crowley begins killing Sam and Dean's old
				friends, they decide to give in.</p>
				<p>In the season finale, Sam and Dean manage to capture Crowley to use him as the last trial and cure him while Naomi
				continues looking for Castiel and captures Metatron, forcing Castiel to work with Dean to finish the angel trials.
				Meanwhile, Sam is interupted by Abaddon but fends her off as Crowley begins to show signs of humanity. Naomi realizes
				that Metatron is not planning to seal Heaven but is planning to break Heaven and cause the angels to fall and that if
				Sam completes the final trial, he will die as God wanted. Dean returns to Sam and in a emotional breakdown they make
				up for their years of mistakes but Sam passes out while Metatron betrays Castiel and takes his grace, making him human.
				Moments later the angels of Heaven fall all across the world to Earth as Sam, Dean, Kevin, Castiel, and Crowley are

				<p>Immediately after the fall of the angels caused by the angel Metatron, the Scribe of God, Sam falls into a coma from
				the effects of the trials to close the gates of Hell and almost dies. With Castiel unable to help (having lost his
				grace), Dean seeks the aid of another angel named Ezekiel, whose only option to save Sam from his wounds is to possess
				him. Dean accepts, and helps Ezekiel trick Sam into giving his consent against his knowledge. The three of them, with
				Kevin (and Crowley as their prisoner), work to find a means to put the angels back in Heaven and are also forced to
				deal with Knight of Hell, Abaddon, who is attempting to seize control of Hell in Crowley's absence and enforce her
				reign of Hell on earth. Also a newly human Castiel must continue to run from the thousands of angels who blame him for
				their setbacks including many of whom are now lead by Bartholomew and Malachi seeking to restore themselves back to
				Heaven under their respective leadership's. Sam and Dean (with the help of Ezekiel) deal with regular hunting cases
				with help from old friends such as Charlie and Jody, but over time Sam begins to notice that something isn't right with
				him which Dean wants to tell Sam about but Ezekiel insists that his presence must remain secret. Eventually, Metatron
				returns to Earth and Ezekiel is revealed to actually be the angel Gadreel, the former protector of the Garden of Eden
				picked by God Himself to protect the Garden but failed by letting Lucifer into the Garden and was then punished by
				being locked away in Heaven's darkest dungeon. Metatron makes a deal with Gadreel to rebuild Heaven together by
				allowing certain angels to return which Gadreel, seeking to redeem himself accepts. Dean discovers Gadreel's deception
				and tries to warn Sam, but Gadreel takes full control and kills Kevin. Meanwhile, Castiel reclaims his powers by
				stealing the grace of another angel. Dean and Castiel team up with Crowley to expel Gadreel from Sam's body, but are
				forced to let the King of Hell go in exchange for his help.</p>
				<p>Sam is furious at Dean's deception, and their relationship becomes strained as they struggle to deal with Kevin's
				death. While Sam is still at the Bunker and Castiel starts a mission to find Metatron on his own and stay clear of
				Bartholomew, who eventually finds him and tries to convince Castiel to join him, Dean then teams up with Crowley in his
				hunt for Abaddon to find the only weapons that can kill a Knight of Hell, the First Blade and the Mark of Cain. Both of
				which Dean acquires from Cain himself, the first born son of Adam and Eve, who killed his brother Abel and became the
				original Knight of Hell as well as the trainer and creator of the rest of the Knights, including Abaddon. Sam helps
				Castiel look for Gadreel, while Castiel comes face to face with Bartholomew who wants him to join his faction of
				followers hunting for Metatron. Castiel disagrees with Bartholomew's ruthless methods and kills him in self-defense,
				causing a number of angels to ask Castiel to lead them (much to his chagrin). Dean eventually finds Abaddon and kills
				her, but the Mark of Cain begins to affect him, bestowing him with great strength, but also a painful desire to kill.
				Meanwhile, Metatron continues to play God with the power of the angel tablet and starts enacting public miracles to
				become a deity to mankind and they begin to slaughter and praise in Metatron's name. Gadreel grows tired of Metatron's
				lies and defects, teaming up with Castiel to try and stop him.</p>
				<p>In the season finale, Sam and Castiel worry about the Mark's influence on Dean, but eventually realize that he's their
				best shot at defeating Metatron. Castiel and Gadreel try to infiltrate Heaven to destroy the angel tablet and cut off
				Metatron's power, allowing Dean to kill the angel, but they are caught and put in Heaven's dungeon. Gadreel is forced
				to sacrifice himself as part of a spell to free Castiel. Meanwhile, Sam arrives too late to stop Metatron from stabbing
				Dean through the heart and his brother dies in his arms. Castiel manages to trick Metatron and take back Heaven, but
				chooses to spare his life and locks him in Heaven's dungeon though is dying from his draining grace. Sam tries to
				summon Crowley to fix Dean, but instead Crowley shows up in the bunker of his own choice where Dean's body has been
				placed and puts the First Blade back into his hands, which revives Dean as a demon.</p>

				<p>After being resurrected by the Mark of Cain, Dean is now a demon, working alongside Crowley. Meanwhile, Sam continues
				to search for Dean. After Dean refuses to follow Crowley's order and embarrasses him in front of his demon followers,
				Crowley gives Sam his brother's location. For giving up Dean, Sam gives Crowley the First Blade. Later, Sam, with the help
				of Castiel, cures Dean by using sanctified human blood and returns him to his human state. After being cured, Dean is
				reminded by Castiel that the Mark of Cain is still a problem. Dean and Sam help Castiel track down Claire, Castiel's
				vessel Jimmy's, daughter. Dean ends up slaughtering several men who are keeping her captive and loses control of the Mark,
				a nightmare he previously had.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile, a mysterious new witch comes into play, being revealed to be Crowley's mother Rowena. Also, the angel Hannah
				goes back to Heaven so that her vessel can have her life back. A large focus of the season is Dean's quest to overcome the
				Mark of Cain and have it removed if possible. After the Mark causes him to break Charlie's arm, Sam suggests that Dean has
				the ability to at least partially control the Mark, but only if he can control himself. New hope for ridding Dean of the
				Mark comes when Charlie unearths the Book of the Damned. Sam needs help in reading and using this powerful tome, and turns
				to Rowena for help, keeping the entire thing a secret from Dean. He requests help from Charlie, too, who decodes the text
				but is murdered by the Steins, a family that has secretly controlled much of history. After massacring the Steins, nearly
				killing Castiel and getting another hunter killed, Dean starts despairing of being free of the Mark, causing him to turn
				to Death for help. Death proposes putting Dean in isolation away the Earth, but insists Dean must kill Sam, who otherwise
				would work to bring Dean back. Sam and Dean both agree that it is for the good of the world. At the last moment however,
				Dean seemingly kills Death instead to save Sam. Oblivious to the dangers, Rowena successfully casts the spell to remove
				the Mark and unleashes the Darkness, a primordial evil that had been kept away by the Mark. Rowena also places Castiel
				under a spell so he attacks Crowley as she escapes with the Book of the Damned.</p>
