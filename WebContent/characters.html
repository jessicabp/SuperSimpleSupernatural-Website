				<h2>Dean Winchester</h2>

						<p>HOVER TO VIEW TEXT</p>
					</div>
				<p>Dean Winchester is a human and hunter as well as a member of the Men of Letters with his younger brother Sam. He and
				his brother are members of the Winchester and Campbell families, and Dean is also the destined vessel of the archangel
				Michael. He and Sam are also the surrogate sons of Bobby Singer. Dean is best friends with the angel Castiel, close
				friend to the late prophet Kevin Tran, and reluctant ally of Crowley. Dean has an ex-girlfriend, Lisa Braeden who he lived
				with for a year when he thought Sam was in Hell. She has a child named Ben, who Dean acted as a father for. Dean is also
				the former apprentice of Alastair. Both Dean and Sam were raised in the hunting life by their father, after the demon
				Azazel killed their mother. Dean's main role in the series is being the self-appointed guardian of Sam and often going to
				extreme lengths to protect him regardless of personal cost. Often in these occurrences Dean finds himself the center of a
				much larger picture. When he was killed by Metatron whilst using the Mark of Cain, Dean returned as a demon and a Knight
				of Hell loyal only to himself. He was then cured by his brother using purified blood. Eventually, the Mark was removed,
				but the price was that the Darkness has now been released into the world, something Dean tried to avoid.</p>

				<h2>Sam Winchester</h2>
				<div class="spoilers">
					<div class="hovertoview">
						<p>HOVER TO VIEW TEXT</p>
					</div>
				<p>Samuel "Sam" Winchester is a hunter as well as a Man of Letters, along with his older brother Dean. He is one of the
				main protagonists of Supernatural. Both Sam and Dean are related to the Winchester and Campbell families - a Letters
				family and a Hunting family respectively. The pair also share a bloodline with Cain and Abel. Because of this, Sam was
				predestined to be the vessel of the fallen archangel Lucifer (whilst Dean was Michael's). Sam is friends with angel
				Castiel, Prophet Kevin Tran, the demon Meg and former lover turned enemy of demon Ruby. He is also the reluctant ally of
				demon Crowley and for a time was forced to be an unknowing and unwilling vessel for the angel Gadreel (before expelling
				him).</p>
				<p>After the demon Azazel killed their mother, both Sam and Dean were raised in the hunting life by their father John. Sam
				left the Hunting life to pursue a career in law, and most likely would have married his college sweetheart Jessica Moore.
				At the series' start, Sam was reluctant to start hunting again. When Jessica was killed, he was pushed back into the
				hunting life. However, he has been repeatedly known to try and back out of Hunting in the hope of finally having a normal
				life as he wanted. Sam is very mentally strong, evidenced by his ability to overpower possession by Lucifer. It has been
				argued that he is the smarter of the Winchester brothers, although Sam himself would disagree. Over time Sam has resigned
				himself to the Hunting lifestyle and has repeatedly sacrificed himself for the greater good, highlighting his selfless
				nature.</p>

				<h2>Castiel</h2>
				<div class="spoilers">
					<div class="hovertoview">
						<p>HOVER TO VIEW TEXT</p>
					</div>
				<p>Castiel, often shortened to Cas, is a powerful angel of the Lord who was responsible for saving Dean Winchester from
				Hell, on the archangels' command. It was his job to help prevent Lilith from breaking the 66 Seals that, once broken,
				would release Lucifer from his cage in Hell. Once Castiel learned that the angels wished to free Lucifer anyway, he defied
				his angelic brethren and died trying to help Dean prevent Sam Winchester from breaking the last seal. After he was killed
				by Raphael, Castiel was resurrected by God and joined Sam, Dean and Bobby Singer in a quest to stop both Heaven and Hell
				to prevent the brothers from becoming the vessels of Michael and Lucifer. When the Apocalypse was averted, he was again
				resurrected with new powers, being promoted to Seraph. He then started a civil war in Heaven to prevent Raphael from
				restarting the Apocalypse. Thinking he could not be outsmarted by a demon, Castiel teamed up with Crowley to claim the
				souls of Purgatory. He ended up betraying Crowley and absorbed all the souls, resulting in his powers reaching the level
				that of a god, but at a high price: the powers that the evil souls granted him had warped Castiel's mind, causing him to
				proclaim himself as the new God.</p>
				<p>Castiel later agreed on the advice for Dean to release the souls back into Purgatory. While seemingly successful, it
				turned out that the most powerful entities, the Leviathans, from Purgatory held on to Castiel, and overpowered and took
				control of him. When the Leviathans leave to take over new forms, Castiel was presumed dead, but survived - apparently
				resurrected by God yet again. Dean later accidentally finds Castiel as an amnesiac healer called Emmanuel. After taking on
				Sam's madness and experience in Hell in order to save the Winchesters and redeem himself for what he did to Sam, Castiel
				had become insane and fell into a coma. However, he awakens and his sanity is returned to an extent when a signal was sent
				to all angels upon the discovery of the Word of God and the appointment of a new prophet. He then aids the Winchester
				brothers against Dick Roman, only to be transported to Purgatory with Dean.</p>
				<p>While Dean returns, Castiel has not returned with him. While his condition is initially unknown, it's revealed that he
				spent most of his time running from Leviathans and that he didn't escape Purgatory with Dean as he had planned to stay as
				a form of penance. However, he was eventually released from the monster realm by an incursion of angels under the orders
				of a mysterious but powerful angel named Naomi and would rejoin the Winchester brothers and tried to become a hunter
				himself. But after a long while, Castiel learned that Naomi has been controlling him ever since she got him out of
				Purgatory and compelling him to find the angel tablet, at any cost, even going as far as killing Dean. When he almost did
				so, after that, Castiel then teamed up with Metatron when the angel convinced him to help him close the gates of Heaven.
				So after collecting the heart of a nephilim and the bow of cupid, Metatron is eventually captured by Naomi but escapes and
				kills her, only for Cas to discover Metatron's betrayal and plan to cause all angels in Heaven, even the imprisoned ones,
				to fall to Earth.</p>
				<p>After being stripped of his grace by Metatron in order to expel all angels from Heaven, Castiel spends the next three
				months on Earth as a human. After being captured and tortured by an angel named Malachi, Castiel steals the grace of Theo
				and returns to his original status as an angel (previously being promoted to a Seraph). Castiel later assists Dean with
				expelling the angel Gadreel from Sam and heals Sam's wounds. After Dean leaves with Crowley to find a way to defeat
				Abaddon, Castiel also leaves to begin a search for Metatron and Gadreel while being pursued by other angels and eventually
				kills rebel leader Bartholomew and assumes command of his faction but a deception of Metatron's makes him lose his army
				but instead teamed up with angels Gadreel and Hannah to infiltrate Heaven and destroy the angel tablet, cutting off
				Metatron's power to allow Dean to kill him. Though successful, Dean and Gadreel were killed, while Castiel locked up
				Metatron. He has currently left Heaven as he doesn't want to be a leader and was dying due to his burning-out grace before
				Crowley saved him with Adina's grace. He has since reclaimed the last of his own grace and restored to full power and
				being a Seraphim.</p>
				<p>Castiel's legacy has seemed to become legend among angels &amp; demons alike, as many recognize him as the only angel who
				defied God's rules &amp; cooperated with humans on his own decision, which he is either loathed or respected for. He is also
				the only angel to have been killed and resurrected multiple times.</p>

				<h2>Crowley</h2>
				<div class="spoilers">
					<div class="hovertoview">
						<p>HOVER TO VIEW TEXT</p>
					</div>
				<p>Fergus Roderick MacLeod (c. 1661 - 1723) was a human, who after death became Crowley; a powerful demon who was formerly
				King of the Crossroads and later became King of Hell.</p>
				<p>Although he initially served with Lilith, he went rogue in Season 5 after her death and Lucifer's release, aiding the
				Winchester brothers in resealing the latter back into his cage. With the power vacuum in Hell unoccupied, he appointed
				himself the new King of Hell.</p>
				<p>Crowley allied with Sam and Dean in Season 5 against Lucifer to obtain the Four Horsemen's rings with them to protect
				himself, then with Castiel to obtain the power of Purgatory and briefly with Raphael after his betrayal in Season 6, and
				then with the Winchesters again in Season 7 against the ambitious Leviathans. However, in Season 8, he cuts his allegiance
				to the Winchesters and Castiel, seeking vengeance as well as attempting to capture the Prophet Kevin Tran and The Word of
				God to further his own goals, only to be captured by the Winchesters as part of their plan to close the gates of Hell. In
				Season 9, Crowley was temporarily Sam and Dean's captive while being hunted by Abaddon as part of her plan to take over
				Hell. However, upon being freed as part of a deal with Dean, he has rightfully resumed his post. After Dean was killed by
				Metatron and revived by the First Blade, Crowley guided Dean through the process of becoming a demon. The two spent a
				significant amount of time together, Crowley wishing to run Hell with him, until Dean was cured.</p>
				<p>Crowley's role is often shifting from main antagonist to anti-hero. He was an anti-hero in Season 5, one of the two
				main antagonists in Season 6, an anti-hero in Season 7, the main antagonist of Season 8 and an anti-hero of Season 9 and
				Season 10 once more. However in all of his durations as an anti-hero he is still openly an antagonist usually pulling a
				life threatening stunt on the Winchesters after assisting them. He is currently the longest lasting antagonist in the
				series.</p>

				<h2>John Winchester</h2>

						<p>HOVER TO VIEW TEXT</p>
					</div>
				<p>John Eric Winchester was the son of Henry and Millie Winchester, the husband of Mary Winchester, and the father of Dean
				and Sam Winchester and Adam Milligan. Seeking revenge after his wife was killed by the demon Azazel, John became a hunter
				and raised his two oldest sons to fight the supernatural. When Dean was 26 and Sam was about to get his law education
				started, John mysteriously disappeared, which caused his sons to go back into hunting in order to find him. Eventually
				they found John who sought the Demon killing Colt gun to kill Azazel, but the three were caught in a car crash after a
				brutal encounter with the demon. Soon after John made a deal with Azazel to bring back Dean from death and went to Hell
				for it, but eventually escaped when the Devil's Gate was opened and assisted Dean as a spirit to finally kill Azazel
				before moving on.</p>
				<p>Before becoming a hunter, John was a Vietnam War veteran (USMC) from Lawrence, Kansas, he worked as a mechanic and was
				eventually co-owner (with Mike Guenther) of a garage in Lawrence. John also served as a temporary vessel for the Archangel
				Michael and a temporary vessel for the demon Azazel in said's demon's first true onscreen appearance.</p>

				<h2>Ruby</h2>

						<p>HOVER TO VIEW TEXT</p>
					</div>
				<p>Ruby was a demon devoted to Lucifer's return. After Azazel's death, she conspired with Lilith as to how they would free
				Lucifer from his cage: while Lilith broke the seals, Ruby protected the remaining "special child" Sam Winchester and
				prepared him to break the final seal and become host to Lucifer. This plan was known only to herself and Lilith, causing
				Ruby to be regarded as a traitor by Hell.</p>
				<p>At first, Ruby formed an alliance with an uneasy Sam by promising to help him get his brother out of his crossroads
				deal, but the relationship between the two gradually deepened, the two even becoming sexually active. She manipulated him
				into breaking the final seal by killing Lilith, but once her deceit was realized by the brothers, she was killed with her
				own knife.</p>

				<h2>Bobby Singer</h2>

						<p>HOVER TO VIEW TEXT</p>
					</div>
				<p>Robert Steven "Bobby" Singer was a hunter, an old friend of John Winchester, and over time evolved into a father-figure
				for John's sons Sam and Dean. He was also one of the longest lasting recurring characters, appearing in every season so
				far. </p>
				<p>Bobby became a hunter after he had to kill his wife Karen Singer when she was possessed by a demon. Rufus Turner is the
				hunter who exorcised the demon and helped cover up Karen's death. It was Rufus who introduced Bobby to the world of the
				supernatural, and they hunted together for many years until a hunt went wrong in Omaha around 1993. Sometime in December
				1991, Sam mentions "uncle Bobby," meaning that Bobby met John Winchester and started helping him take care of Sam and
				Dean some time before Christmas of 1991. He took the boys on hunting trips and even played catch with Dean in the park, as
				well as giving Sam the amulet that he (Sam) gave to Dean for Christmas.</p>
				<p>Bobby is killed in season 7 after being shot in the head by a Leviathan. He refuses to go with the reaper who comes to
				collect his soul, and becomes a ghost tied to his old flask. After he starts to become more vengeful, he asks the boys to
				burn the flask, and release his soul.</p>
				<p>In season 8 it is revealed that Bobby's soul went to Hell, and Sam breaks him out, getting him into Heaven as part of
				the trials to close the gates of Hell.</p>

				<h2>Jody Mills</h2>

						<p>HOVER TO VIEW TEXT</p>
					</div>
				<p>Jody Mills is the sheriff of Sioux Falls, South Dakota. She is an ally of the Winchesters, and occasionally helps them
				in their cases. She was also affiliated with Bobby Singer before his death.</p>
				<p>Jody was married and had a son, Owen, who died and came back zombie whom the Winchester boys took out during the
				Apocalypse. She had a history with Bobby Singer, who she typically regarded as a troublemaker and a drunk before the
				events of the series.</p>
				<p>In season 9, Jody returns to her police station to find a vampire named Cody attacking a young woman in one of the
				jail's cells. Acting quickly, Jody decapitates Cody with a fire ax and calls in Sam and Dean to help as she overheard Cody
				mentioning that more vampires would be coming after the girl. Jody finds out she is Annie Jones, a girl kidnapped eight
				years before with no surviving relatives, however, she insists that she be called Alex. It turns out the vampires are
				using Alex to lure in humans to feed on. While raiding the vampire's nest with the Winchester boys, Jody is captured by
				the vampire "mother" Celia who tries to get Alex to feed on Jody to complete her transformation into a vampire. Alex
				refuses and Jody realizes that Celia lost a daughter named Alex and kidnapped and renamed Annie Jones to replace her dead
				daughter. Celia admits this while Jody admits that she's been trying to fill the void in her life created by the death of
				her family with many things, including Alex. Celia tries to drain Jody of her blood and kill her, but Alex saves her.
				Telling Alex not to look, Jody retrieves her weapon and decapitates Celia. As Alex didn't feed, Celia's blood is used to
				cure her. Jody takes Alex home, and becomes like a mother to her.</p>
