				<p>Demons are malevolent spirits created by Lucifer. They are created from corrupted human souls that have endured
				extensive torture in Hell by Alastair and other demons. They become corrupted and extremely evil, and also very powerful,
				in this process. The species as a whole functions as the series' primary antagonists and are the most recurring
				supernatural creatures in the series. Similar to Angels, they require a Vessel to walk the earth, though are able to roam
				in their smoke form.</p>
				<p>Demons are the result of human souls going to Hell and being tortured until no humanity is left in them, thus turning
				into demons - dark, malicious spirits that revel in pain, chaos, and death. According to Ruby, most demons forget what it
				means to be human. Some have even forgotten that they were once human. In general, demons engage in torture and
				destruction because it is fun or to avoid being tortured themselves. Some demons, however, are true believers in Lucifer's
				agenda to "cleanse" Earth, and actually consider themselves morally superior to humans.</p>

				<p>Wendigos were once humans, but after being forced to eat human flesh to survive, they become supernatural monsters that
				retain little human features they once possessed. After their transformation, they begin to crave human flesh and feed
				solely on it.</p>
				<p>Wendigos are never clearly seen in the show, only in shadows, so the audience doesn't know exactly what they look
				like.</p>
				<p>At the same time, Wendigos are embodiments of gluttony, greed, and excess; never satisfied after killing and consuming
				one person, they are constantly searching for new victims. It is also common that wendigos just capture humans to hoard
				their food, and then eat when hungry.</p>
				<p>Wendigos are rarely seen out of Minnesota or the north of Michigan. They are hundreds of years old, and they also have
				hibernation behavior during the long, cold winters they must survive--meaning they must hoard food if it is scarce. In
				addition, they keep their victims in dark and isolated places, such as caves or abandoned mines.</p>

						<p>HOVER TO VIEW TEXT</p>
					</div>
				<p>The Leviathans, also called "The Old Ones", Chompers, or Levis for short, were ancient, primordial monsters, as well as
				God's very first beasts. Thus, they pre-date angels, humans, and the soul itself. The creatures proved to be too hungry
				and destructive, so God created Purgatory and locked them inside. They were inadvertently released when Castiel opened
				Purgatory and absorbed all the souls inside in order to defeat Raphael.</p>
				<p>Upon their release, the Leviathan attempted to conquer the Earth and place themselves as the new dominant species on
				the planet, subsequently harvesting the human race as their primary and abundant food source while eliminating all other
				competitors and threats to their food.</p>
				<p>This attempt to subjugate mankind was thwarted through the combined efforts of hunters, angels, demons and even
				monsters but was ultimately stopped by Dean Winchester and Castiel after they managed to defeat the Leviathans leader and
				architect of their plan: Dick Roman. According to Crowley the Leviathans themselves disbanded after Dick's death and are
				scattered but their actual fate is unclear.</p>

				<h2>Vampires</h2>
				<div class="spoilers">
					<div class="hovertoview">
						<p>HOVER TO VIEW TEXT</p>
					</div>
				<p>Vampires, or Vamps for short, are a race of blood-drinking supernatural creatures that were once human. They have been
				encountered by the Winchesters, Gordon Walker and other hunters. However it has been stated encountering a vampire is very
				rare as hunters have hunted them near to extinction although due to their ability to reproduce by transfusion there only
				needs to be one for them to repopulate.</p>
				<p>All vampires originate from the Alpha Vampire. Vampires are also one of the most frequently recurring supernatural
				creatures in the series. They live forever, and several depicted vampires are hundreds of years of age or older. They also
				mate for life. Their diet is based strictly on blood, and while human blood is preferred, they can survive by ingesting
				the blood of other animals (although one such vampire, Lenore, refers to cow blood as 'disgusting'). Vampires must keep
				their victims alive or their blood becomes toxic to them. Vampires can only be killed by beheading, where they leave
				behind a corpse that can be examined to find their vampire teeth.</p>

				<h2>Alphas</h2>
				<div class="spoilers">
					<div class="hovertoview">
						<p>HOVER TO VIEW TEXT</p>
					</div>
				<p>Alphas stand as the fathers of their allotted species. As the creators of their specific species, each of them are much
				more powerful because of literally being the first of their kind. As well as this, they also possess several unique
				powers:</p>
				<p>Telepathic Link - They possess a telepathic link to their children, allowing them to track or communicate with them
				over great distance. They can also learn knowledge their children possess.</p>
				<p>Immunity - Alphas are more resistant to certain weapons that harm lesser members of their races. For example, the Alpha
				Shapeshifter is immune to silver and the Alpha Vampire demonstrated a high degree of resilience to dead man's blood.</p>
				<p>Link to Eve - Although all monsters possess a link to Eve, the Alphas possess a stronger link.</p>
				<p>Immortality - Even if their species is not immortal, the Alpha is, provided they are not killed. This is supported by
				the fact that while Shapeshifters are not immortal, their Alpha did not die until recently, when he was beheaded by
				Crowley, despite having been alive the last time Eve, the Mother of All, walked the Earth, when all Alphas were
				created.</p>
				<p>Resistance - The Alpha Shapeshifter was only slowed down by an amount of tranquilizer fluid that would have taken down
				an elephant, it can be assumed all Alphas share this trait.</p>
				<p>Endurance - The Alpha Vampire was not even phased by being electrocuted, so it stands to reason the other Alphas have
				an extreme pain threshold as well.</p>

				<h2>Reapers</h2>
				<div class="spoilers">
					<div class="hovertoview">
						<p>HOVER TO VIEW TEXT</p>
					</div>
				<p>Reapers are angels that serve Death. They assist in maintaining the Natural Order and used to be thought as completely
				neutral, aligned with neither Heaven nor Hell nor Purgatory, although now that it is shown that they are angels, it is
				assumed they work for Heaven. According to Castiel, Reapers will sometimes appear in mass gatherings in prelude to a great
				disaster such as the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in Pompeii. Being the servants of Death, Reapers are one of the most
				recurring supernatural creatures in the series.</p>
				<p>Reapers are required for death to occur, they wait until a person meets the end of his or her life (either through
				accident, or simply the natural end point of that person's life) and then touch the person causing them to die, they then
				escort their souls to Heaven or Hell. Reapers are similar to cupids, and they wait for orders from Heaven, that tell them
				who they are supposed to kill. They do not however possess the power to force souls to go with them. It's unknown if they
				are required for death to occur to all beings or simply humans and monsters.</p>
				<p>Although sometimes uncaring, Reapers generally sympathize with their victims, but refuse to make allowances, regardless
				of who or why. As they can't force anyone to go with them, Reapers must convince the souls to leave with them, which they
				normally achieve by forewarning the fate of the souls if they refuse: transforming into vengeful spirits trapped on
				Earth.</p>

				<h2>Angels</h2>
				<div class="spoilers">
					<div class="hovertoview">
						<p>HOVER TO VIEW TEXT</p>
					</div>
				<p>Angels are powerful, celestial beings created by God to serve as his attendants and messengers, but also as soldiers in
				his war against Lucifer and his demons. They are native to Heaven and are imbued with both holy white light as well as
				considerable power. Their true form is nothing less than that of holy righteous beings which are beautiful as well as
				hazardous, overwhelming, and terrifying all at the same time; ranging from two to six (maybe more) large feathered wings
				on their backs, four animalistic heads with halos of light around them, and heights as tall as skyscrapers.</p>
				<p>Angels are one of the most powerful entities in the series, generally outclassing all demons, monsters, and other
				supernatural creatures with the exception of the Leviathans, Eve, The Horsemen, and God Himself.</p>
				<p>Angels are capable of reproducing with humans while in a vessel, creating a Nephilim. Unless they have their Grace, the
				resulting offspring will be human. They cannot reproduce in their natural form, and it is unknown what is born when two
				angels within vessels reproduce. Angels are also among the most recurring supernatural beings in the series.</p>
